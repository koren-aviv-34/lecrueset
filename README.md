Le Crueset Magento Order Review Module
The app.zip file contains all the folders anf files needed for the Magento module compatible with latest 1.9.x community edition.
The Module will do the following:
1.It will send an email to those customers who completed an order after X days (this interval can be defined in the back-office).
2.Said email will refer to a link of the store with a small survey where customers can evaluate from 0 to 5 the quality of the service and have a text field where they can elaborate a short review.
3.Those reviews will sit as pending in the back-office where admins will be able to accept or discard.
4.Finally add a view to the module that shows approved reviews randomly.

A short user manual for said module will be also in the dev branch.
