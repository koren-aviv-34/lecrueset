# Le Crueset Magento Order Review Module
The Module is implemented in the compressed file app.zip,
The Module should be compatible with the latest 1.9.x community edition.

The Module will do the following:
1.It will send an email to those customers who completed an order after X days (this interval can be defined in the back-office).
2.The email will refer to a link of the store with a small survey where customers can evaluate from 0 to 5 the quality of the service and have a text field where they can elaborate a short review.
3.The Reviews will sit as pending in the back-office where admins will be able to accept or discard.
4.Add a view to the module that shows approved reviews randomly.

A short user manual for said module will be also in the dev branch.
